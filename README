This repository implements a Flask API for resume parsing using spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities. It allows users to upload a PDF resume and extract key information like contact details, skills, education, and work experience.

Features:

1) Parses PDF resumes using PyPDF2.
2) Extracts entities using a spaCy NER model (saved model included).
3) Returns identified entities in JSON format.

Requirements:

1) Python 3.12.6
2) Flask 3.0.3
3) PyPDF2 3.0.1
4) spacy 3.7.6

Setup:

1) Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/reksh21/FlaskAPI.git

2) Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the application
python app.py
This will start the Flask application, typically running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 by default.

4) Send POST request with resume PDF:
    - Use Postman client to send a POST request to the /upload-pdf endpoint.
    - Set the request method to POST.
    - Set the URL to http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload-pdf.
    - Select the "Body" tab and choose "form-data" as the mode.
